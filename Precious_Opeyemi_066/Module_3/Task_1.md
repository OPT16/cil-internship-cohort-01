## Software as a service
Software as a service: is a software licensing and delivery model in which software is licensed on a subscription basis and is centrally hosted. SaaS is also known as "on-demand software" and Web-based/Web-hosted software.

### Examples of SaaS
* Microsoft office365
* Google Suite(Gmail, Google Docs, Google Drive, Google Photos)
* Slack
* Dropbox
* AWS

### Characteristics of SaaS
* Managed from a central location
* Hosted on a remote server
* Accessible over the internet
* Users are not responsible for hardware and software updates. Updates are applied automatically.
* The services are purchased on the pay-as-per-use basis.
* Users can gain access to sophisticated applications.

### Benefits of SaaS
1. Minimal risk: Many SaaS products offer a free trial period, or low monthly fees that let customers try the software to see if it will meet their needs, with little or no financial risk.

2. Anytime/anywhere productivity: Users can work with SaaS apps on any device with a browser and an internet connection.

3. Easy scalability: Adding users is as simple as registering and paying for new seats; customers can purchase more data storage for a nominal charge.

### Uses of SaaS
1. Web Hosting and E-Commerce: These include content management systems, message boards, shopping carts, web hosting, and much more. SaaS services of this kind make online business possible and vastly improve the experience for both the customer and the vendor. 

2. Communication Platforms: File sharing, instant messaging, and other functions of this kind improve collaboration and enable teams in disparate locations anywhere on Earth to work together on a common goal.

3. Customer Relationship Management (CRM): Key to any public facing business, CRM helps businesses to track sales, automate marketing tasks, manage customer information, and much more.

4. Accounting: Every business needs accounting services. Only now with SaaS accounting services is it possible for anyone to perform accounting functions themselves. No matter what the size of your business, SaaS accounting services can be a real game-changer.
5. Payment Gateways: This type of SaaS service provider delivers secure and convenient online payment systems. These are used for taking credit card payments, running offers and rewards, processing bank transfers, publishing and tracking coupons, and more.


## Platform as a service (PaaS)
Platform as a service (PaaS): is a category of cloud computing services that allows customers to provision, instantiate, run, and manage a modular bundle comprising a computing platform and one or more applications, without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching the application(s); and to allow developers to create, develop, and package such software bundles.

### Example of PaaS
* AWS Elastic 
* Beanstalk
* Windows Azure
* Heroku
* Force.com
* Google App Engine
* Apache Stratos

### Characteristic of PaaS
* Accessible to various users via the same development application.
* Integrates with web services and databases.
* Builds on virtualization technology, so resources can easily be scaled up or down as per the organization's need.
* Support multiple languages and frameworks.
* Provides an ability to "Auto-scale".

### Benefits of PaaS
1. Faster time to market: PaaS enables development teams to spin-up development, testing and production environments in minutes, vs, weeks or months.

2. Low- to no-risk testing and adoption of new technologies: PaaS platforms typically include access to a wide range of the latest resources up and down the application stack. This allows companies to test new operating systems, languages, and other tools without having to make substantial investments in them, or in the infrastructure required to run them.

3. Simplified collaboration: As a cloud-based service, PaaS provides a shared software development environment, giving development and operations teams access to all the tools they need, from anywhere with an Internet connection.

4. A more scalable approach: With PaaS, organizations can purchase additional capacity for building, testing, staging and running applications whenever they need it.

5. Less to manage: PaaS offloads infrastructure management, patches, updates and other administrative tasks to the cloud service provider.

### Uses of IaaS
1. API development and management: With its built-in frameworks PaaS makes it easier for teams to develop, run, manage and secure APIs for sharing data and functionality between applications. 

2. Internet of Things (IoT): PaaS supports a range of programming languages (Java, Python, Swift, etc.), tools and application environments used for IoT application development and real-time processing of data from IoT devices.

3. Agile development and DevOps: PaaS solutions typically cover all the requirements of a DevOps toolchain, and provide built-in automation to support continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD).

4. Cloud-native development and hybrid cloud strategy: PaaS solutions support cloud-native development technologies - microservices, containers, Kubernetes, serverless computing - that enable developers to build once, then deploy and manage consistently across private cloud, public cloud and on-premises environments.


## Infrastructure as a service (IaaS)
Infrastructure as a service (IaaS) is a type of cloud computing service that offers essential compute, storage and networking resources on demand, on a pay-as-you-go basis.

### Example of IaaS
* AWS
* Microsoft Azure
* Rackspace
* Google Cloud Platform
* Digital Ocean

### Characteristics of IaaS
* Resources are available as a service
* Services are highly scalable
* Dynamic and flexible
* GUI and API-based access
* Automated administrative tasks

## Benefits of IaaS
1. Higher availability: With IaaS a company can create redundant servers easily, and even create them in other geographies to ensure availability during local power outages or physical disasters.

2. Lower latency, improved performance. Because IaaS providers typically operate data centers in multiple geographies, IaaS customers can locate apps and services closer to users to minimize latency and maximize performance.

3. Improved responsiveness. Customers can provision resources in a matter of minutes, test new ideas quickly and quickly roll out new ideas to more users.

4. Comprehensive security. With a high-level of security on-site, at data centers, and via encryption, organizations can often take advantage of more advanced security and protection they could provide if they hosted the cloud infrastructure in-house.

5. Faster access to best-of-breed technology. Cloud providers compete with each other by providing the latest technologies to their users, IaaS customers can take advantage of these technologies much earlier (and at far less cost) than they can implement them on premises.


### Uses of IaaS
1. Run testing and development: The computing and networking power of IaaS makes it a perfect environment to run and manage testing and development cycles.

2. Improve disaster recovery preparation: Because IaaS is scalable and reliable, businesses can consolidate disparate disaster recovery systems into one virtualized environment.

3. Perform big data analysis: Storing and analyzing big data requires a lot of processing power. IaaS is an appropriate environment for big data because it can handle large workloads.

4. Handle spikes in traffic: IaaS can handle unexpected traffic spikes by scaling as necessary.

5. Provision resources quickly: IaaS makes it possible to get new projects up and running quickly when urgent business priorities arise.

6. Startups: Startups can't afford to sink capital into on-premises IT infrastructure. IaaS gives them access to enterprise-class data center capabilities without the up-front investment in hardware and management overhead.
